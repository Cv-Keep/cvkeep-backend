# CV Keep - Front End

CV Keep is a **Free and Open Source Platform** intended to hold **Online Resumés**. It's completely free, pretty and simple. You can use the self-hosted version, or clone the entire project and use for your own purposes - including comercial ones - without any kind of charge or legal implications. If you intend to have an online resumé hosted by CV Keep, just go to https://cvkeep.com and create your account. 

# Self Hosting Your Platform

This is the Back End repository of the platform. Since it is free and open source, you can clone it and do what you want since you use your own brand.
